intro: I am currently leading research for EF's global product design team, responsible for transforming the future of the global company through research-driven design solutions. </br><br/>For EF Finland, I researched and designed an end-to-end journey where students are encouraged to discover great content that makes them excited to book a trip online.

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Context</h2>
        <p>In 2016 the EF Finland website’s primary CTAs were focused on getting customers' contact information through a price quote or a brochure request. The sales person would then call the customer with the goal of helping them to book a language course abroad.</p>
        <p>We were asked by senior leadership to develop a new digital model, where the website informs potential customers about the product with the primary focus of the user booking directly online. In addition, we were asked to focus on mobile.</p>
        <p>As one of two UX designers and primary researcher, I was involved in every aspect of this project.</p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Design research</h2>
        <p>After senior leadership gave us the brief, I had to understand if their assumption - that people would book an expensive language course directly online - was valid. I flew to Helsinki and did a deep dive with customers and the sales team, learning about students and parents and the sales process, students' motivations to learn a language abroad, and how technology could help them make the decision to book easier.</p>
        <p>
        From this research, I sketched user flows and created wireframe prototypes and then tested them in the Helsinki sales office to better understand how users would be more likely to book directly online.</p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Design process</h2>
        <p>Research was ongoing throughout the design process. Here are some of the decisions we made:</p>
        <h4 class="projectSectionTitle">1. Combining products, age group selection</h4>
        <p>The first biggest obstacle we encountered was that we had two different products with separate websites: independent travel and group travel. Within these products existed five different age groups. The company asked us to simplify the products digitally by combining them within one user flow.</p>
        <p>We experimented with presenting the age selections on a splash page, within the flow directly after the homepage, or just before the booking flow on individual destination pages. During research we learned that users were most likely to book if content (pictures, descriptions) was tailored to them specifically. </p>
        <p>After testing and iterations, we decided to put the age group selection after the homepage but just before destinations are presented within the flow, so that the destinations shown are specifically for them, with content that is tailored for that age group.</p>

    <h4 class="projectSectionTitle">2. Booking flows</h4>
    <p>Another challenge were the booking flows, which I couldn't change completely because they had to rely on an existing API from the global company (over 53 countries). But in research, I set aside our technical constraints and asked simply: when the user is ready to book, what do they want to do first?</p>
    <p>This question and further research led me through several booking flow iterations, three of which I prototyped and tested with users:</p>

    <p>I learned from the sales team that many customers have difficulty choosing the right destinaton. To help users make the right choice, I worked with customers and the sales team to understand how we can help customers with this decision making process. After interviews, I came up with filter selections to help users narrow their top picks, depending on destination type (beach, city, or college town), activities (swimming, volleyball, dance), and more...</p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Impact</h2>
        <p>We have shifted the company paradigm of what makes an online experience successful: instead of asking potential customers for contact information through primary CTAs, the internal conversation has shifted to creating a content-rich website that promotes booking directly online. In addition, one year after launch, customers are booking twice as much online as they did in the previous year.</p>
        <p>
        We are currently testing this new digital model in other markets.</p>
