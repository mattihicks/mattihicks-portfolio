        <p>I created a video with a videographer showing what happens when parents send their child on an EF language trip. I conducted all the on-camera interviews, drew the storyboard, directed the editing changes, and pushed it live onto the product website:</p>

<!--         <p>After working with stakeholders on the research objectives, I decided to utilize semi-structured interviews with the following sample groups to meet the research objectives:</p> -->
        <ul>
          <li>
        Ten to fifteen <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">student interviews</span> within each market</li>
        <li class="objectiveResearchList">Four to five <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">parent interviews</span> within each market</li>
        <li class="objectiveResearchList">Eight to ten <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">sales coordinator</span> and <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">customer service team interviews</span> within each market</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Along with a designer and field expert, I also conducted an affinity diagramming workshop and a sales blueprint exercise with marketing, sales, and customer service representatives.</p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Involving the project team</h2>
        <p>It's critical to involve the project team and other stakeholders in the research process as much as possible - they are owners of the process, too. Everyone on the team is invited to contribute to the research - from formulating the research questions to conducting the user interviews to ideating on what kind of deliverables the team can expect.</p>
        <p>In addition, each day I am out on the field, I jot down sentiments or thoughts from the research day and share these with the team with a fair warning that we cannot make conclusions yet on what I'm discovering - but it helps the team to "peer in" to what's ongoing if they're busy.</p>

        <h4 class="projectSectionTitle">1. Customer interviews</h4>
<p>Customer interviews was partly influenced by the <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">JTBD theory</a> to get to the heart of how the digital touchpoints impact the customer experience. Example questions asked:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">What was the conversation like when you talked about learning a language abroad with your parents? With your friends?</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">To parent: what were your initial thoughts about your daughter studying abroad?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">How did you contact friends and family back home?</span></p>
                      <p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">If you were traveling abroad again with EF, what would you hope to get out of
your next trip?</span></p>
        <h4 class="projectSectionTitle">2. Sales and customer service team interviews</h4>
<p>To add context to the customer journey, I interviewed between 6-8 sales coodinators and 1-2 customer service team members from each market. During these interviews, I dived into their relationships with customers during their language trip, asking questions such as:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">How do you first get in touch with customers?</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">What questions do customers ask?</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">What are the most common customer complaints you hear?</span></p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Results and impact</h2>
        <p>I can't disclose my findings for confidentiality reasons, but here's some of the outcomes and action items I took:</p>
        <p>1. I created a <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">customer journey diagram with eight stages</span> that the customer experiences throughout their EF journey. We are currently building on this research to go deeper within the eight stages I defined.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>2. I am collaborating with the product owner as this research directly impacts the <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">product roadmap</span>; we've uncovered multiple product opportunities for 2019, and most likely beyond.</p>
        <p>3. <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">Feature and content improvements</span> are in planning, development, or testing stages, including providing more information about what the student will experience as well as an increased emphasis on authenticity in the product.</p>
