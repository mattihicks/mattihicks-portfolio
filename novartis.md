        <p>As the lead user researcher and designer, I was involved in a number of projects related to improving how people communicated and shared information with each other. Along with the product manager and tech lead, I developed a longterm product strategy and roadmap on how best to improve collaboration throughout the company from results of a large organizational survey, workshops, and interviews. </p>
        <p>In addition, I developed a series of personas based on this research to help the project team stay human-focused, rather than technology-focused throughout the duration of the project.</p>
        <p>Projects that fell under our domain: <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">scientist profiles, lab profiles, activity stream, and our internal video channel</span>.</p>
        <p>For confidentiality reasons, I can't go indepth into these research areas. But I can provide you with a glimpse of methods I used as well as a prototype we tested.</p>

        <p>One of these initiatives was 'Activity Stream', a project focused on sharing information about colleagues, instruments, and publications among project teams. I conducted twelve <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">contextual inquiries</span>, visiting oncology labs in Boston and Basel and understanding how teams collaborated with each other.</p><p>I followed up these site visits with <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">interviews</span> with the lab heads to better understand how they work.</p>

        <p>Based on this research, we developed a web app focused on sharing information about colleagues, instruments, and publications among project teams. Our pilot was with a group of oncology scientists, because they were well-networked, shared information throughout the organization, and demonstrated a healthy work environment, meaning: lab heads who were active in internal forums and encouraged collaboration among their lab scientists.</p>
        <p>After developing an initial prototype, we learned that what the prototype lacked most was providing updates that directly related to the scientists' work, such as information on new compound structures or up-to-date information about the instruments the scientists were using. We then utilized APIs that displayed scientific data and saw an uptick in use. Scientists in other departments began asking for app access.

        In addition to user research, I was responsible for designing the early concept wireframes, mockups, and prototyping the UI in HTML/CSS/JS for the user feedback sessions, and also learned how to use the javascript library D3 to visualize scientific connections.</p>
