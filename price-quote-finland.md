        <h2 class="projectTitle">Context matters</h2>
        <p>To ground the research in the company knowledge we already had, I spoke with stakeholders and dug into archives to discover where it came from and why stakeholders held strong beliefs in its effectiveness for lead conversion. I wanted to undertand why the price quote was a quantitative success and what tests they have done to improve it over the years.</p>
        <p>I then poured over quantitative reports showing how the price quotation CTA compared to other CTAs on the site and also created an analytics dashboard to see current drop off rates within each step of the form filling process.</p>
<p>This work helped me to build a solid research foundation on, so that moving forward I could work within the context of the problem space as well as communicate the research findings in a more effective way.</p>

        <p>I sent a short <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">survey</span> to people who have recently filled out a price quote. From this survey, I took the most recent (within the past week) and "data rich" responses and conducted a round of <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Medium">phone and Skype interviews</span> to gather more in-depth information.</p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Surveys sent</h2>
<p>I sent a short 3-minute survey to over four hundred people who have recently (within the past two months) filled out a price quotation form. Here are a couple of questions I asked:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">Why did you fill out a form to get a price quote?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">Did you fill out a price quote before or after you looked browsed a destination page?</span></p> 
<p>We received more than one hundred responses and I shared them with my project team. Sidenote: as we received over 25% response rate, I wish I'd made the survey longer (taking perhaps 8 minutes instead of 3) and asked more questions, although this may have led to a decrease in response rate.</p>

<p>Although I cannot discuss the actual findings for confidentiality reasons, we discovered an intriguing theme in about half of the responses.</p>
<p>I needed to probe deeper into this insight.</p>

        <p>To avoid hindsight bias, I recruited people who have requested a price quotation within the past week. Each of these interview recruits had responses that I wanted to go deeper into. Example questions asked:</p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">Do you remember seeing the price on the website? If so, where?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">Was there information on the site that you weren't getting that made you want to fill out a price quote form?</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">Did you tell anyone you ordered a price quote? If so, who? What did they say?</span></p>

        <h2 class="projectTitle">Impact</h2>
        <p>As a result of this research, I collaborated with the product owner to plan a list of experiments to improve people's ability to get an exact price directly from the site, without decreasing leads. This included:</p>
        <ul><li class="objectiveResearchList">New price component on the destination pages</li>
          <li class="objectiveResearchList">A/B testing CTA copy</li>
          </ul>

           <h4 class="projectTitle">Custom bot test</h4>
            <p>One of the experiments involved testing a chat bot, which I implemented and was introduced by a video from a language consultant. This research also builds on other <a href="https://mattihicks.com/international-research">research efforts</a> which are trying to bring a more personable experience to the product.</p>
            <p>In the video below, the language consultant says (in Finnish): <span style="font-family:GT-Walsheim-Regular-Italic">"Hello, my name is Daniel. Would you like a personalized price quote? I am here to help if you need anything"</span> and then the bot leads the user through a price quote request.</p>
